# 🏗 Framework Design

This project follows the **Page Object Model (POM)** design pattern to improve maintainability and scalability.

Each page contains its own:

* Locators
* Page actions
* Assertions
* Navigation methods

Benefits include:

* Cleaner test files
* Better code reuse
* Easier maintenance
* Reduced duplication
